/* So I need use 0x55683560(can't be arbitrary) to cover the old EBP value of the attack stack frame */
/* I need to use buf prior address to cover the return address(the same as level 2) to execute my attack code */

/* Then my attack assemble code can pass the cookie 0x118e7330 to %eax, and pushl 0x08048e81 to return right */
